# My-Portfolio-Website
Have a look at my FIRST EVER Portfolio website! This contains HTML and CSS for now, and I will be adding JavaScript as well as React to this very soon. Let's see what happens with this experience.

This is the assignment for week 1 in the course "Web Programming I". We are required to create a portfolio website with some rules and conditions, using the material that had been provided.

We had to make 4 pages that were linked to the main page i.e. index.html.The others are named cv.html, hobbies.html and contact.html.

There is a file named style.css for the css rules as well to make the website a bit organized.
